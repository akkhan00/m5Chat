### Files Ready for Deployment:
- âœ… `index.html` - Main HTML file
- âœ… `script.js` - Updated with Railway backend URL
- âœ… `style.css` - Styling
- âœ… `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration with SPA routing

## ðŸ”— Production URLs

**Backend (Railway):** https://skillful-laughter-production.up.railway.app
**Frontend (Netlify):** *Will be provided after deployment*

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployment

Once both are deployed, test the full application:

1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Enter a username and room name
3. Send test messages
4. Open in another browser/incognito to test multi-user chat
5. Verify messages disappear after 5 minutes

## ðŸ›  Configuration Details

### Backend Configuration:
- **Platform:** Railway
- **Runtime:** Python with Nixpacks
- **Database:** SQLite (persistent across deploys)
- **WebSocket:** Socket.IO with ASGI
- **Auto-cleanup:** Messages expire after 5 minutes

### Frontend Configuration:
- **Platform:** Netlify
- **Type:** Static SPA (Single Page Application)
- **API Connection:** HTTPS to Railway backend
- **WebSocket:** Socket.IO client with fallback to polling
- **Security Headers:** Configured in netlify.toml

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

### Backend (Railway):
- `PORT` - Auto-set by Railway
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Set to "*" for development (consider restricting in production)

### Frontend:
- API_URL is hardcoded in script.js pointing to your Railway backend

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Logs

- **Railway Logs:** `railway logs` (from backend directory)
- **Netlify Logs:** Available in Netlify dashboard
- **Client Logs:** Browser developer console

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS Errors:** Backend allows all origins, should work from any domain
2. **WebSocket Issues:** Client falls back to HTTP polling automatically  
3. **Route Issues:** netlify.toml configured for SPA routing

### Quick Fixes:
- Check Railway service status in dashboard
- Verify Netlify build logs
- Test API endpoints directly with curl
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## ðŸŽ‰ Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Share your Netlify URL with users
2. Monitor usage in Railway/Netlify dashboards  
3. Consider adding custom domain names
4. Set up monitoring/alerts if needed
